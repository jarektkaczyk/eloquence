Currently available extensions:

1. [Validable](https://github.com/jarektkaczyk/eloquence-validable) - self-validating models
2. [Mappable](https://github.com/jarektkaczyk/eloquence-mappable) -map attributes to table fields and/or related models
3. [Metable](https://github.com/jarektkaczyk/eloquence-metable) - meta attributes made easy
4. [Mutable](https://github.com/jarektkaczyk/eloquence-mutable) - flexible attribute get/set mutators with quick setup 
5. [Mutator](https://github.com/jarektkaczyk/eloquence-mutable) - pipe-based mutating

By installing this package you get aforementioned extensions. Alternatively you can pull just single extension:
